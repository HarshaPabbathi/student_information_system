Student Information System (SIS) üöÄ
Overview
This is a Django-based Student Information System (SIS) designed to manage student-related data, including Student profiles, Course details, Enrollment records, Instructor information, Assignment tracking, and Attendance logs. The application uses Django's ORM to interact with a MySQL database, with models explicitly mapped to corresponding database tables.

Project Structure üìÇ
The project includes the following key files in the student_management Django app:

apps.py: Configures the student_management Django application, specifying the default auto field and app name.
models.py: Defines the database models for the application, including:
Student: Stores student details such as name, email, and enrollment date.
Course: Manages course information like course name, code, and credits.
Enrollment: Tracks student enrollments in courses, including grades.
Instructor: Stores instructor details such as name, email, and department.
Assignment: Manages course assignments with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
Attendance: Records student attendance for courses with status (Present, Absent, Late).


admin.py: Registers all models with the Django admin interface for easy management.
views.py: Placeholder for view functions (currently empty, to be implemented).
tests.py: Placeholder for unit tests (currently empty, to be implemented).
manage.py: Django's command-line utility for running administrative tasks like migrations and server startup.


Setup Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Django 3.2+
MySQL (or another compatible database)
Virtualenv (recommended)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd sis


Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install django mysqlclient


Configure the database:

Update the DATABASES setting in sis/settings.py to match your MySQL database configuration:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}




Run migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


Create a superuser (for admin access):
python manage.py createsuperuser


Run the development server:
python manage.py runserver

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Access the admin interface:

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with the superuser credentials.
All models (Student, Course, etc.) are registered and can be managed here.




Database Schema üóÑÔ∏è
The models are mapped to the following MySQL tables (as specified in the Meta classes):



Model
Table Name
Description



Student
students
Student data


Course
courses
Course data


Enrollment
enrollments
Enrollment records


Instructor
instructors
Instructor data


Assignment
assignments
Assignment details


Attendance
attendance
Attendance records


Each model uses AutoField for primary keys to align with MySQL's auto-incrementing IDs.

Next Steps üìù

Implement views: Add logic in views.py to handle HTTP requests and render templates for user interaction.
Create templates: Design HTML templates for the front-end interface.
Write tests: Add unit tests in tests.py to ensure the reliability of the application.
Add relationships: Update models to include ForeignKey relationships (e.g., ForeignKey for student_id and course_id in Enrollment) for better data integrity.
Enhance security: Configure proper user authentication and authorization.
